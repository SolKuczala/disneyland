[Música]

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,939
[Aplausos]

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,359
muchas gracias

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,679
es un gran placer estar aquí una vez

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,960
nuevamente en buenos aires

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,360
y en muchas ocasiones he estado en argentina

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
y he celebrado el software libre con

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
ustedes

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,960
mi charla de hoy es una charla muy especial

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:48,480
porque este es un año muy especial

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:52,079
son 50 años desde 1969

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,800
y en 1969 hubo muchos

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:00,000
eventos interesantes

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,960
número uno la gente caminó sobre la luna

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
y el planeta entero se detuvo

dieciséis
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
ese día

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,000
mientras la gente corría hacia todos los televisores

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,159
de el mundo

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,640
para ver a la gente más asombrosa

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
y se unieron en todo el mundo

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,560
por este concepto de gente caminando

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
en un cuerpo diferente en el espacio

23
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,280
algo menos importante pero aun asi

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,759
importante era woodstock

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,479
un festival de música gigante en los estados unidos

26
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,000
estados para establecer el tono de la música

27
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,200
durante las próximas décadas

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,759
en 1969 en la ciudad de nueva york

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,079
hubo un motín en un lugar llamado el

30
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,159
stonewall inn

31
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,799
donde las personas trans estaban siendo

32
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,680
intimidadas y heridas y gente gay y

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,200
personas de diferentes tipos de diversidad

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,759
estaban siendo perseguidas por la policía

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,000
y causaron un motín que inició el

36
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
comienzo de la comunidad y movimiento lgbtq

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,399
en los

38
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,360
estados unidos

39
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,399
en un pequeño laboratorio en bell labs en

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
New Jersey

41
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
dos personas iniciaron una pequeño sistema

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
operativo

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,000
solo por diversión, ellos no pensaron que era

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
va a ser importante

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
solo estaban tratando de hacer una investigación

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,760
en nuevas ideas de sistemas operativos y

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,280
ver un poco más sobre eso

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,760
en esta charla Arpanet

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,519
fue fundado y eventualmente se convirtió en el

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Internet

51
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,519
y la gente nunca soñó que el

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,920
Internet sería lo que es hoy

53
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
de hecho, el espacio de direcciones del

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,879
Arpanet original

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,959
eran solo 15 bits

56
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,760
por lo que no podría tener muchos hosts

57
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
en Helsinki finlandia paso desapercibido 

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,519
salvo

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
para los padres de Linus Torvalds, porque fue el año del nacimiento de 

60
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,440
Linus

61
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,319
si Linus Torvalds tiene 50 años

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,560
este año que me hace sentir increíblemente

63
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,560
viejo

64
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,519
en 1969 yo era un estudiante universitario

sesenta y cinco
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,680
como muchos de ustedes yo estaba estudiando

66
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,159
Ingeniería Eléctrica

67
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
y la mitad de mi carrera fue en negocios

68
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,360
y administración

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,680
Casi fui electrocutado por 13600

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,480
voltios y 800 amperios

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,280
lo que casi me guió hacia el software

72
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,280
y programación

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
finalmente en 1969 fue el último año 

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,360
en el que me he 

75
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,959
afeitado, ahora notarías un poco

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
asterisco al lado de eso

77
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,120
lo que indica a lo largo de mi charla

78
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,959
que hay otra historia detrás de eso

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
pero no tenemos tiempo para todos esos

80
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,560
cuentos

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,760
pero más asteriscos hay, más

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,080
largo y a veces mejor la historia es
83
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
y si me invitas a salir con una birra

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,799
a veces puede ser que te las cuente

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
pero, vamos a volver al 

86
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
principio, no demasiado al principio de

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,439
la ciencia de la computación

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,560
pero cuando empece a programar

89
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,799
y la computadoras eran físicamente inmensas

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,239
trabaje para una compañía llamada Aetna Life
91
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
and casualty(?)

92
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,000
y eran los usuarios comerciales mas grandes
93
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,080
de equipamiento de IBM en el mundo libre
94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
que te va a mostrar que si pones suficientes
95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,600
adjetivos alrededor vos, vos podrías ser el

96
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,320
mejor de cualquier cosa 

97
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
soy el el hombre mas guapo con
98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
barba blanca

99
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,960
y pelo parado en este escenario en este

100
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
podio, ves? soy el mejor

101
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
pero las computadoras eran también lógicamente muy

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
chicas

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,759
tendrían capaz 4000 bytes de

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,560
memoria

105
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
y trabajarían con dispositivos que

106
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
podrían

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,560
leer y escribir datos a cinco caracteres

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,800
cinco bytes por segundo

109
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
esto era medido en megabytes no

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,479
gigabytes o terabytes

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
como hacemos hoy y los programas

112
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,199
corrían

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
una vuelta a la vez en la computadora aun si

114
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:13,039
la computadora era un mainframe

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,400
y aun si costaba 2.5 millones de dolares

116
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,720
los programas eran corridos de a uno a la vez

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
y, y muchas de estas computadoras tenían

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
switches

119
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
y luces en el frente de ellas porque

120
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,639
vos podías usar esos switches

121
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,720
y luces para depurar tu programa

122
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,039
porque tu programa era la única cosa

123
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,600
que estaba corriendo

124
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,520
y si había un sistema operativo, era

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,240
increíblemente primitivo

126
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,759
para los standards de hoy era típicamente

127
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,520
especializado en hacer un tipo de cosa

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,080
tal vez podrías hacer un trabajo por lotes en las tarjetas

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
o quizás si tenias realmente suerte, you

130
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,520
had a time

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,840
sharing system that would you could have

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,600
terminals attached to

133
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,199
there were computers that were dedicated

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,280
to real-time processes

135
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,199
and there was there's a rumor and it's

136
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,319
still a thought pattern today

137
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,800
that companies created different

138
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,360
operating systems because they were

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
trying to

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,240
lock their customers into their hardware

141
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,280
they were trying to get their customers

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
to write to that

143
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,960
operating system because that would tie

144
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,160
that customer to their equipment

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,840
now if this was true then the digital

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,080
pdp-11

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
computer system that was very popular in

148
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,520
the day

149
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,039
would only need to have one operating

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,000
system

151
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,080
but instead we had 11 different

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,319
operating systems

153
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,240
because what we were trying to do was

154
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,880
make that piece of hardware

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,039
be more efficient in running our

156
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,160
customers programs

157
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,280
and so we wrote the operating system

158
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,120
to do specialized tasks we had an

159
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,440
operating system for doing

160
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,479
health style of work and an operating

161
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,120
system for doing

162
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,039
educational style of work and an

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
operating system for doing real-time

164
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,400
style of work and so forth and so on

165
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,520
we actually had two different unix

166
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
systems

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,319
running on our pdp 11.

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,720
and if we were just trying to lock our

169
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,319
customers into buying our equipment

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,360
we would need only one

171
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,360
now also back in those days most

172
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,479
of the code that was distributed was

173
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,639
distributed in source code form

174
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,520
there wasn't enough of one type of

175
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
computer

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,000
to really justify creating a binary

177
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,599
code and manufacturing it like cookie

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,120
cutters

179
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,520
and so if you ordered a compiler

180
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,479
you might spend one hundred thousand

181
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
dollars

182
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,520
for that compiler and you might

183
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,440
negotiate with the company for several

184
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,319
months with your lawyers talking to

185
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
their lawyers

186
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
about how many systems could you put

187
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,280
that compiler on

188
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
and how many people could use it at one

189
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,919
time

190
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,759
and in the end you ended up

191
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,120
with the source code for that compiler

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,360
you kept that

193
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,599
in your vault or in your lawyer's vault

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
because what happens if that little

195
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000
company that you bought it from goes out

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
of business

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
there were also very few professional

198
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,080
programmers

199
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,320
there were there weren't people who

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,240
really wrote programs for other people

201
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,159
to use

202
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
and if you were a programmer it was

203
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,080
because you were also a physicist

204
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,560
and you needed the program to do your

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
work you were an electrical engineer

206
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,680
and you needed the program to do your

207
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
work

208
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,920
you're an educator and you needed the

209
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,839
program to do your work

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,200
in fact i had a professor at the

211
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,200
university drexel

212
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,320
who said to me john you'll never be able

213
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
to

214
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,560
earn a living being a professional

215
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,839
programmer

216
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,200
and i'm still waiting to see if he was

217
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,920
right

218
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
there were also no software copyrights

219
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
or patents

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,839
you could not copyright software you

221
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,200
could not patent software

222
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
the way you protected your software was

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
to

224
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,640
contract law making one of these

225
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,120
contracts

226
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,600
and getting people to sign it and this

227
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
required much money and many lawyers

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,320
even before you

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,040
touched the software and there was also

230
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,399
many points of sharing

231
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,040
there were vendors groups like dekus for

232
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,040
the digital equipment user society

233
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,399
share for ibm brainstorm for novell

234
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,480
where people who wrote these programs

235
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
would contribute their programs in

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,839
source code form

237
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,839
to people to use

238
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,200
and and why did they do this why didn't

239
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,920
they sell

240
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,959
their software well quite frankly

241
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,600
selling software is hard work

242
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,839
you have to guarantee bug fixes to your

243
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,200
software you have to write documentation

244
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,240
for your software

245
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,680
you have to distribute your software all

246
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
these different things

247
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
and the people that wrote this software

248
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,640
were not

249
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,440
in the business of selling software

250
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,079
they were physicists and engineers and

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,320
educators

252
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,000
so they gave away their software to

253
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
other people who they thought could use

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,519
it

255
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
and sometimes these people would meet

256
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,680
them

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,240
at these meetings like decas and say oh

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,640
you wrote that great software i'm using

259
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
thank you very much it's very helpful

260
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,320
i have some ideas to how to make it

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
better or

262
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,480
gee you wrote that software that really

263
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,839
saved my life

264
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
let me buy you a beer

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,640
or they did a really great job let me

266
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,959
buy you dinner

267
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,440
well you did a really great job let me

268
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,440
give you a job

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,279
and these a lot of these reasons are the

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,720
same reasons that people write free

271
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,399
software today

272
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,640
they write it because they need it for

273
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,560
themselves

274
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,839
and they write it because they can

275
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,920
demonstrate

276
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
their programming skills and a lot of

277
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,959
times get a job

278
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:31,920
or generate a service out of writing it

279
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,880
now i've described the computing

280
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,320
industry

281
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,360
in 1969 but

282
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,839
this one guy named ken thompson had been

283
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,600
working on a project called baltics

284
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
there was a combination of different

285
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
companies coming together

286
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,000
and trying to create a be all end-all

287
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,760
operating system

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,079
called baltics and eventually ken

289
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,160
thompson was taken off of this project

290
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
and brought back to bell labs in new

291
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
jersey

292
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,480
and he was very upset about this because

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,920
he liked

294
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,760
working on operating systems and he met

295
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,959
up with this other man named dennis

296
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
ritchie

297
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,120
and together they started to create this

298
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,560
little operating system that they called

299
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,760
unix because baltics was everything for

300
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,240
everybody

301
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:25,360
and unix was one thing for one person

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,519
and they started by saying well instead

303
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,320
of putting all the functionality

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,079
in the center of the computing system

305
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,040
called the kernel

306
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,000
let's make the kernel very small and

307
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,680
have it do

308
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,680
some things very well and then all the

309
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,519
other things that people need will move

310
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,720
outside of the kernel

311
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,200
into these things called libraries

312
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,839
and this made it easier to get that

313
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,600
kernel

314
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,519
to be correct now the first couple of

315
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
kernels were written in the ones and

316
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,760
zeroes

317
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,600
of machine language but after a while

318
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,040
dennis richie said boy this is really

319
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,279
difficult

320
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,360
um i'm going to invent this language

321
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,920
called c

322
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,040
and we'll rewrite the kernel in c and

323
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
then it'll be much more

324
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,320
portable to the next system we bring it

325
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,320
to

326
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,680
and they kept working on this to make it

327
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,120
more and more

328
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:25,200
portable now this was a

329
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,639
strange thing in those days because

330
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,600
computers were so expensive

331
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,440
that who cares if you have to train your

332
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
person to use a different operating

333
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
system

334
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,000
to be more efficient for running your

335
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,720
program

336
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,680
because the machine was worth more than

337
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,680
the people were

338
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:51,120
and dennis and ken had this idea

339
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,959
that people were actually more expensive

340
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,079
than the machines were and as the cost

341
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,199
of the machine started to drop

342
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,440
this became more and more true

343
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,040
that it became easier and easier to buy

344
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,680
a new machine with the same

345
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,959
operating system on it and the same

346
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
commands

347
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,800
and the same libraries maybe a different

348
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,360
machine

349
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,079
architecture but that was hidden from

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,639
you by the operating system

351
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,720
and people found out that i can use the

352
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
same programs and the same command

353
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,880
whether the machine comes from

354
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,959
hewlett-packard or ibm or compaq

355
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,240
or any number of other companies that

356
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,360
are no longer in existence

357
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,160
and at first this this operating system

358
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,320
was distributed in source code form

359
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
and this allowed universities to

360
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,079
participate in bringing good

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,839
ideas into this a collaborative effort

362
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,160
and ken and dennis would bring in some

363
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
ideas and toss away others and things

364
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,680
like that they were the architects of

365
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,240
the system

366
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,240
but despite the fact that a lot of

367
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,680
people think that unix was free

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,680
it was never free it was always owned by

369
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,959
a t and t

370
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,360
and sometimes it was barely even open

371
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,519
because only universities that were

372
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,920
researched universities

373
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,399
could get the code for a reasonable

374
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,360
price

375
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:25,600
350 u.s dollars to put the code on

376
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,000
all of the computers at your university

377
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,959
if you were a small two-year technical

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
college

379
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,839
like the one i taught at you had to get

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,959
a different license

381
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,360
and that license was 160 000

382
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:44,240
us dollars per cpu

383
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,560
and you had to tell somebody at the

384
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,800
telephone company

385
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,639
the serial number of the computer you

386
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,160
were putting it on

387
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,839
now how many of you have ever tried to

388
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
call somebody at the telephone company

389
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
it's like trying to call somebody at

390
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,120
google

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,560
do you know in the 150 million pages

392
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,959
that google is in charge of

393
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,800
web pages there's not a single telephone

394
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,279
number

395
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,480
you can't call people at google you can

396
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,839
barely send them email

397
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,639
so this concept that unix was free and

398
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,000
open was

399
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,079
a myth

400
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
these remember these guys were creating

401
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,639
this operating system

402
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
just for fun they were researchers

403
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,800
they didn't mean to sell this or

404
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,199
anything they wanted just wanted people

405
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,759
to use it

406
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,399
and other contributions from unix

407
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,920
systems

408
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,600
was a small command interpreter which we

409
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,480
call the shell

410
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,320
it still exists today even in linux a

411
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,839
lot of you use the shell you call it

412
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
bash

413
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,279
well this show was called the bourne

414
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
shell

415
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,360
it was written by a man named steve

416
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,639
bourne and it was simply

417
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,120
sh later on there was another shell

418
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,680
written

419
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
that extended that at the university of

420
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,240
california berkeley

421
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,839
and it used the c syntax so it was

422
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,160
called

423
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:13,919
csh and then another

424
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
show was written by a man named dave

425
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,959
cord it extended that

426
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,160
and it was called the corn shell ksh

427
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,160
and so forth and so on eventually the

428
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,360
free software foundation

429
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,799
wrote to shell over again making it free

430
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,559
software

431
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:36,400
they called it the born again shell

432
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,840
bash which a lot of you use today

433
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,400
but this was a new concept normally

434
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,000
all this functionality was in the kernel

435
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,080
of the operating system

436
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,320
which made the kernel bigger and more

437
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,320
complex and more likely to fail

438
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,280
one of the great features of unix and

439
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,200
the unix command line is something

440
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,200
called pipes and filters

441
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,679
which allows you to take the output from

442
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,679
one command and feed it into the input

443
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,080
of the next command

444
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,000
this is this was another new concept and

445
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,640
it was so new

446
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,480
that the person who invented it named

447
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,559
doug mcelroy

448
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
had to actually write some of the first

449
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,799
unix commands

450
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,240
to show ken thomps ken thompson and

451
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,840
dennis ritchie

452
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,480
how this worked things like portable

453
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,080
network

454
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,720
file systems came from unix and a client

455
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,919
server windowing system was developed at

456
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,799
mit

457
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,080
for unix systems and there were many

458
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,520
more

459
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,840
very radical ideas that came out of the

460
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,600
unix

461
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,520
marketplace now

462
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,000
all of these unix systems were being

463
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,080
developed by universities

464
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,320
and the universities would pass around

465
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,480
the source code

466
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,480
but if but the source code was still

467
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,559
very expensive

468
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,400
if you were a company you'd had to pay

469
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:05,919
two hundred sixty thousand dollars

470
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,640
and so what happened in 1962

471
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,520
was a little company called sun

472
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,840
microsystems

473
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,840
had formulated a small computer

474
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,280
that was built and designed to stanford

475
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,880
university

476
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,440
and they said we want to have a

477
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,720
powerful operating system on top of this

478
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,000
little computer

479
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,600
ms-dos was too weak and miserable

480
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,559
for this system cpm another operating

481
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
system of the day

482
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,280
was only good for 64 bits of

483
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,559
i'm sorry um 16 bits of address space

484
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,600
various 65 000 bytes of memory so

485
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,840
both of these were just too weak

486
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,840
sun actually came to my company digital

487
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,320
equipment corporation and said we want

488
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,240
to

489
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,120
take one of your operating systems but

490
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,240
that was impossible

491
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,400
so they decided to use

492
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,919
the university of california berkeley's

493
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
version of unix

494
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,200
which is called bsd and

495
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,559
they wanted to go to the telephone

496
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,760
company and say can we have

497
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,880
a better license a cheaper license for

498
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,600
this

499
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,919
and the telephone companies said okay if

500
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,559
you distribute unix

501
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,640
only in binary form not the source code

502
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,400
you can sell it for three hundred fifty

503
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,320
dollars per machine

504
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,480
and you do not have to tell us what the

505
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,880
serial number is

506
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,640
and sun microsystems said wonderful

507
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
we'll do that

508
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,760
now you have to remember that even

509
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,960
though this was a small

510
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,919
desktop computer it was still selling

511
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,400
for fifteen

512
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,240
thousand dollars back in 1982.

513
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
that's about half the price that my

514
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,120
parents paid for their house

515
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,039
a three-bedroom house with brick

516
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,039
it had a living room a dining room a

517
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:03,039
family room a two-car garage

518
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:06,400
one a quarter acre of land they paid 32

519
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,559
000 for it so this workstation

520
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
that sat on your desk and allowed you to

521
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,120
do work

522
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,039
was half the price of their house

523
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,159
but people still paid it because it

524
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:22,320
allowed them to do amazing work

525
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,000
and they put this unix license on top

526
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,280
now other companies like digital

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,720
equipment corporation and

528
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,919
hewlett-packard

529
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,880
and ibm saw the business model and they

530
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
too

531
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,159
started to bring out their own versions

532
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,440
of unix

533
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,640
also in binary only form

534
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,640
not in the source code

535
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,320
but most of them utilize the code from

536
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,440
the university of california berkeley

537
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,559
and the reason for that is that the att

538
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,600
code called system 5 was

539
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,760
a swapping type of operating system

540
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,960
it meant that you had to have your

541
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,400
entire program

542
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,480
in memory at one time the berkeley

543
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,080
system used something called demand page

544
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,679
virtual memory

545
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,200
which meant you only had to have a

546
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,320
certain portion

547
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,360
of your program in memory at one time

548
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,760
this was more desirable

549
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,559
system five only had two compilers that

550
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,240
came with it

551
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,039
c and fortran 77.

552
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
the berkeley code had three compilers

553
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,080
they added pascal

554
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,320
but the most important thing was the

555
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,280
system five networking

556
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,360
was a dial up networking called unix to

557
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
unix copy

558
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,440
where your computer system would

559
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,080
actually dial up over the telephone

560
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
lines

561
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,720
make a connection to the next system and

562
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,320
pass the data on

563
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,450
and the berkeley system had implemented

564
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,600
tcpip

565
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,919
[Music]

566
00:22:51,600 --> 00:23:00,320
remember tcpip it came from the internet

567
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,320
that was started in 1969

568
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,400
but one thing that the university of

569
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,840
california did not have

570
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,520
that system five did was a big marketing

571
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,799
budget

572
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,480
and so for the next 10 years every week

573
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,559
in the middle of this big computer

574
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,360
magazine a t

575
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,919
would have an advertisement for system 5

576
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,280
the right

577
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,799
choice but nevertheless they still

578
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,600
lost now there was one person who

579
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,120
objected

580
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:35,760
to this binary only copy of

581
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:39,280
unix he was a student at mit

582
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,640
in in boston

583
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,559
and he decided that he liked seeing the

584
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,279
source code for these operating systems

585
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,400
it was worthwhile having it it made it

586
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,240
easier to maintain the operating system

587
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,360
his name of course was richard stallman

588
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,480
and he announced this project called gnu

589
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,520
a project to completely rewrite

590
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
all of unix in source code and make it

591
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,080
freely

592
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,360
available and the first

593
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,200
piece of code he wrote was emacs

594
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,640
a text editor now emacs is so complex

595
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,559
that most people say he could have

596
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,200
stopped with emacs and he would have had

597
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,080
his complete operating system

598
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,240
but he went on to do other programs that

599
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,880
were useful to programmers

600
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,520
and these programs would work on

601
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,120
different

602
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,520
operating systems so you could use emacs

603
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,520
on

604
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,000
mvs and vms and unix systems

605
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,000
and so forth and all of a sudden

606
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,200
programmers got the idea

607
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,799
got the information that yes i only have

608
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,919
to learn my text editor

609
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,039
one time and i can use it on

610
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,120
all these other different systems

611
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,400
and the next thing he did was write some

612
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
compilers

613
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,240
that worked on all these different

614
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,000
systems

615
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
and people start to say well i can write

616
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,159
my code the same way

617
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,080
on all these systems and the only thing

618
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,159
i have to watch out for

619
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,600
are the system calls to the actual

620
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,520
operating system itself and he started

621
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,440
to gather more and more people that saw

622
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,799
this vision

623
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,799
and in 1985 he created the free software

624
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,240
foundation

625
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,530
which i bear the brand on his shoulder

626
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:39,200
[Applause]

627
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:42,320
[Music]

628
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,640
now he kept doing this you know

629
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,679
first the emacs and then the compiler

630
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,799
suite and then

631
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,600
various utilities and people began to

632
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,640
understand

633
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,960
that this was allowing people to be

634
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,760
portable across these different

635
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,640
operating systems

636
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,400
and this also allowed some small

637
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,279
companies to start up

638
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,240
giving support to this software that was

639
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,080
written by the free software foundation

640
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,279
some of them simply gathered up the

641
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,240
source code

642
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,679
and put them onto cd-roms and sold the

643
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,640
cd-roms

644
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,480
other people actually printed books

645
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,200
about how to use this software

646
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,080
and o'reilly is one of the major book

647
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,240
manufacturers that did that

648
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,279
and some companies like a company called

649
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
cygnus

650
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,720
actually supplied support to major

651
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,440
corporations like boeing

652
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,640
to use these compilers on different

653
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,679
systems

654
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,840
they did some work specifically paid for

655
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
by these companies that the free

656
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,600
software foundation

657
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,559
didn't have access to the machines or

658
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,480
the people

659
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:56,080
to do it and so people started realizing

660
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,880
that you can make money by supporting

661
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,799
free software

662
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
now the company i worked for digital

663
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,520
equipment corporation

664
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,080
we had been supporting unix from the

665
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,640
telephone

666
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,520
company from bell labs on our deck

667
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,200
hardware

668
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,840
but we were mostly writing device

669
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,000
drivers and things like that

670
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,919
and i joined digital in 1983.

671
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
i'm going to stop here for a moment and

672
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,240
i realized that most of you were not

673
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,240
born at that time

674
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
some of you your fathers were not born

675
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,279
at that time

676
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,880
but i joined in 1983 and

677
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,960
uh we were bringing out a unix system

678
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,320
based on 4.1

679
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,039
berkeley software distribution we bought

680
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,559
out two of them one of them was a

681
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,559
32-bit a 16-bit system called ultrix 11

682
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,039
and one was a 32-bit system called

683
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,080
ultrix 32.

684
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,880
now this started these unix wars

685
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,039
as different vendors started to see that

686
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,240
there was this market

687
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,360
that could be satisfied with unix mostly

688
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,080
it was a scientific and technical market

689
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,640
and software development market and

690
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,640
educational market

691
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,320
that was about 16 percent of the

692
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,159
marketplace

693
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,640
the other 84 of the marketplace

694
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,919
was what we call commercial software

695
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,200
which is represented by

696
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,240
banks and you know commerce and things

697
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,600
like that

698
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,159
that was still in the mainframe and

699
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,080
batch and proprietary operating system

700
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,360
area

701
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,159
databases were also you know in that

702
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,480
area

703
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,960
and they typically ran on commercial

704
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,960
systems

705
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,679
so there were two groups that formed one

706
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,399
was called unix system labs

707
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,000
which was made up of sun microsystems

708
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,200
and a tnt

709
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,440
that joined together and the sun did a

710
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,559
very stupid thing

711
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,880
they decided to abandon the code from

712
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,000
the university of california berkeley

713
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
and instead support the code from system

714
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,159
5

715
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,399
of bell laboratories this was a decision

716
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,600
made by upper management

717
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,600
for political reasons and the engineers

718
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,919
looked at the code from

719
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,480
a t and said this is terrible

720
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,039
and so the very first release of their

721
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,279
new code base was called

722
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:34,799
slolaris because it was so slow

723
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,919
compared to sun os their bsd base

724
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,240
eventually they did the optimization to

725
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,960
bring it up to speed

726
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,440
the other companies like dec ibm and

727
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,760
others

728
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,279
formed a group called the open software

729
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,440
foundation

730
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,480
and what they did was create a set of

731
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,159
standard

732
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,120
programming interfaces and a test suite

733
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,880
and a set of standards to say if you can

734
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,480
pass these standards

735
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,000
then you can call yourself unix

736
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,840
this was a radical idea because it meant

737
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
that you could

738
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,440
implement an operating system using

739
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,559
any code base you wanted to

740
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,799
as long as the programming interfaces

741
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,679
stayed the same and it also meant

742
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,720
that the most important thing was the

743
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,000
brand

744
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,159
of the product unix

745
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,559
it allowed people to know what they were

746
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,559
getting

747
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,399
now this started some wars companies

748
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,919
vying back and forth

749
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,520
and eventually in 1991

750
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,080
unix system labs sued a tiny little

751
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,200
company called bsdi

752
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,919
and said you're using a t

753
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,720
code without paying royalties to the

754
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,640
telephone company

755
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,840
and bsdi said no no the code that we get

756
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,799
is all from the university of california

757
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,320
berkeley

758
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,120
and the telephone company said no

759
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,600
there's still some you know a telephone

760
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,240
code

761
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,039
in there and this dragged on for years

762
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,080
and this stopped people from moving

763
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,640
forward

764
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,840
with the bsd code as a solution

765
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,559
to a free operating system

766
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,559
eventually

767
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,120
the bsdi people and the university of

768
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,159
california berkeley

769
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,799
got rid of all of the atnt

770
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,760
code at that point they created a

771
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,640
distribution called bsd lite

772
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,279
that became the basis of certain

773
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,559
operating systems that still exist today

774
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:56,880
in the open source space netbsd

775
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,880
freebsd and openbsd

776
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,240
but that was 1994.

777
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,600
in 1991 there was

778
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,880
a student named

779
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,559
lena's torvalds at the university of

780
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,559
helsinki and he had gotten a brand new

781
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,559
386 computer

782
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,600
for christmas and the 386

783
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,320
computer had a facility to it a feature

784
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,480
to it

785
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,519
that no other intel system had before

786
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,880
and that system that feature was to be

787
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,720
able to run

788
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,159
demand page virtual memory

789
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,559
remember the importance of that

790
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:47,679
from where unix came from years before

791
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,399
lenas knew that his system had that

792
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,600
capability but the operating system

793
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,279
that came with it from a company

794
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:01,120
named microsoft did not take advantage

795
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:04,000
of that feature because microsoft

796
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,760
was still supporting the customers using

797
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,120
the 186

798
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,200
and the 286 that did not have this

799
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,240
feature

800
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,279
so lenas decided he was going to write a

801
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,320
kernel

802
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,919
that used this feature and this would be

803
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,320
his operating system he was writing it

804
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,000
for himself just for fun

805
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,679
and he sent out a message over the

806
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
internet he said i'm writing this

807
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,399
operating syst just for fun

808
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,120
it's not going to be as big and powerful

809
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,799
as medics

810
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,720
and people started joining him with that

811
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,159
and giving their expertise and their

812
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,039
time to help to generate this kernel

813
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,360
which would then be the core of the

814
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,480
operating system that some people call

815
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,519
gdu linux now

816
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,159
why could this happen at this time

817
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,840
why at this time why not before when not

818
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,159
after

819
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,600
is because there were these cheap

820
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,760
powerful computers

821
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,879
and the 386 was not new in 1991

822
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,480
it was actually a several years old

823
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,960
and people had older 386 computers

824
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
lying around their house that they could

825
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,359
say oh

826
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,320
i can dedicate this computer to this

827
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,320
linux project

828
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,440
and there was also faster internet to

829
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,200
the house

830
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,280
both dial up and dsl and cable

831
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,320
which allowed people to do this work at

832
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
home

833
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,399
not having to do the work at the

834
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,320
university or doing the work at their

835
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,359
employment

836
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,159
there was a lot of information online

837
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,679
about how to build operating systems

838
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,440
there was the minix model

839
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,960
of building operating systems and there

840
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,800
were other toy

841
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,119
or other operating systems that were

842
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,160
done that people could see

843
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:07,200
the techniques of using them and in 1989

844
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,160
the world wide web had been invented

845
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
and was now maturing to make it easier

846
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,160
to transfer

847
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,680
huge amounts of data with links

848
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,960
to make this production easier

849
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,800
and even porn was easier

850
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
back because of the world wide web

851
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:33,839
so in 1994 which were three years after

852
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,560
lena started his curdle project and

853
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,240
ten years after the gnu project was

854
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,720
created

855
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:46,079
people brought together the linux kernel

856
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,680
and various parts of the lytic system

857
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,359
to create the gnu linux system

858
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,640
now at that time system vendors

859
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,800
except for sun had given up the desktop

860
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,680
computer to microsoft

861
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,440
and microsoft owned ninety percent of

862
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,160
the desktop market

863
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,119
with apple owning seven percent and

864
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,040
everything else

865
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:14,320
owning three percent windows nt

866
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,280
had been invented by by microsoft it was

867
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,480
not only

868
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,520
it's used in some desktops but also

869
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,320
using server systems and this was

870
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,800
scaring

871
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,240
the large vendors because this is where

872
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,520
they used unix

873
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,599
and this is where they used their

874
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,480
proprietary systems

875
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,480
and microsoft was eating into that space

876
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,640
tim o'reilly had actually stopped

877
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,560
producing books on unix because he said

878
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,320
it was a dying market

879
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,680
and he was actually producing books

880
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,240
about windows and tea

881
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,839
i don't blame him he had people that

882
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,200
were working for him

883
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,200
he had to keep them with jobs so

884
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,160
i don't really blame him for for

885
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,200
deserting the unix market

886
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,079
but in 1994

887
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,200
venus had finished version 1.0 of the

888
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,079
linux kernel

889
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,480
and had released it now when you create

890
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,359
operating systems

891
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
a version anything less than version one

892
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,880
is still

893
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,359
a heavily developing model it's not

894
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,119
really

895
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,640
ready for everybody to use version one

896
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
is the signal to people

897
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,520
that this is an operating system that

898
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,960
you can use

899
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,680
now i met lenas at a deacos meeting

900
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,960
in new orleans in 1994 and the reason

901
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,520
that new orleans

902
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,280
has two asterisks behind it is that

903
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,160
there are two cities in the united

904
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
states which are

905
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,520
adult disneylands one of them

906
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:51,280
is las vegas the other is new orleans

907
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,000
and i love new orleans

908
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,040
and i met linus and i saw linux for the

909
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,520
first time

910
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,680
and i sat down and i used linux and i

911
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,520
said wow this is really good

912
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,880
this is not this is on a weak miserable

913
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,680
crappy intel computer chip

914
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,880
it isn't a vax it isn't an alpha this is

915
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,320
one of these weak

916
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,720
miserable crappy intel chips and this

917
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,079
felt really good it was really peppy

918
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,640
this was something really good

919
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,200
and i said to lena's linus would you

920
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,680
like to create a 64-bit version

921
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,359
of linux because the alpha was a 64-bit

922
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,119
computer

923
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,920
why is that important with 32 bits you

924
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,079
can access

925
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,119
4 billion bytes of data at one time

926
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,160
but with 64 bits you can access 4

927
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,400
billion

928
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,680
times four billion bytes of data

929
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,680
how much data is that

930
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,599
that will fill up a one gigabyte disk

931
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,000
every second of the day

932
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,079
every day of the year for the next 5

933
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,160
386 years

934
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,200
or it'll allow you to store 128 bytes of

935
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,520
data

936
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,040
for every square millimeter on the

937
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,480
surface of the earth

938
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,640
including all the oceans it's a lot

939
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,119
of data and

940
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,000
it allows him to support multiple

941
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,920
processes not just intel and amd

942
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:33,200
but alpha and motorola and arm

943
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,240
and all the rest that were coming and he

944
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,280
said yes

945
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,560
he'd be happy to do that so i gave him a

946
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,720
thirty thousand dollar computer system

947
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,680
and i got some engineers from digital to

948
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,599
help him

949
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:51,599
and then i began to understand the power

950
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,000
of the free and open source community

951
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,400
the people who took their own money to

952
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,359
go out and buy alpha processors

953
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,640
so they could help with this project of

954
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,000
pointing linux

955
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,440
to the 64-bit system and in nine

956
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,920
months we did a port

957
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,839
a port where most of the people never

958
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,960
met each other face to face they

959
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,240
only worked over the internet

960
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:24,160
and i had engineers at digital

961
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:27,520
who told me that this was impossible

962
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,240
and at that point the new linux exploded

963
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,280
and it wasn't just gnu linux but it was

964
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,520
software from

965
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640
all these different places came together

966
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,760
from mit

967
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,560
from from bsd from other from carnegie

968
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,599
mellon from

969
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,599
all these different places and but the

970
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,119
operating system still had no real

971
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,480
applications

972
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,440
no commercial applications but what was

973
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,040
happening

974
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,440
was the world wide web remember that

975
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,720
and the world wide web needed server

976
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,319
systems

977
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:04,240
that were had shells and it had

978
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,160
a web server and it had email services

979
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,640
and all these things were

980
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:13,599
on unix and now got put it to linux

981
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,200
and it was on these weak miserable

982
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,480
crappy but cheap

983
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,079
intel systems that people started to put

984
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,280
into place

985
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,760
as routers as firewalls

986
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,839
they started reusing old equipment that

987
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
could no longer run microsoft

988
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,040
to do all these things at no

989
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,960
additional expense

990
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,079
several other things happened in rapid

991
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,240
succession 1994 where beowulf

992
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,560
supercomputers came into being we'll

993
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,240
talk more about those in a moment

994
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,000
in 1998 databases like informix and

995
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,480
cybase and oracle

996
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,079
all ported to unix systems or linux

997
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,079
systems

998
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,480
and that meant something to me because

999
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,599
this was exactly the same

1000
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,640
set of procedures and steps

1001
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,119
that other operating systems took as

1002
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,319
they

1003
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,680
started to gain momentum

1004
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,200
in the year 2000 embedded systems chose

1005
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,920
linux as being the

1006
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,079
most used system for embedded system

1007
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,560
designs

1008
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,119
up until this point embedded systems

1009
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,440
were

1010
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,800
specific operating systems written by

1011
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,839
people

1012
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,400
but in the year 2000 customers started

1013
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,440
saying

1014
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,280
we want our embedded systems to talk

1015
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,119
to the internet oh my god

1016
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,240
that means they have to be secure

1017
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
and they have to have a tcp stack oh

1018
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,079
that's difficult

1019
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,839
oh my god what are we going to do

1020
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,599
there's an operating system

1021
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,680
that already runs on all these

1022
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:56,000
processors it already has a tcp stack

1023
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,119
it already is secure and it's called

1024
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,839
linux

1025
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,839
and it's free

1026
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:08,720
and overnight people started using linux

1027
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,319
for new embedded system designs

1028
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,119
i mentioned super computers in 1994

1029
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,079
supercomputers were very expensive but

1030
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:21,599
the companies that made them were dying

1031
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,040
companies like ecl cray

1032
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,119
control data corporation

1033
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,280
and you would design one of these

1034
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,200
systems and only four people would buy

1035
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,960
them

1036
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,200
sometimes they were government agency

1037
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,680
that we dare not say their name

1038
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,680
we dare not talk about the nsa

1039
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,359
and some a couple universities would

1040
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,319
take it but universities never pay you

1041
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,240
for anything

1042
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,000
because they don't have any money so you

1043
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,760
might actually sell one of them

1044
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,200
and that just wasn't enough to keep you

1045
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,000
alive

1046
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,200
so the companies were dying and these

1047
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,839
two people

1048
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,319
donald becker and dr thomas sterling

1049
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,680
said

1050
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:06,400
we need supercomputers because of

1051
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,200
one very very special problem

1052
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,720
you may not even think about it's a

1053
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,480
problem called

1054
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,480
fluid dynamics

1055
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,319
you know i tell people that math is

1056
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,960
behind

1057
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,960
everything math is behind physics and

1058
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,240
physics is behind the real world

1059
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,319
well fluid dynamics is the essence of

1060
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,560
math and physics

1061
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,800
fluid dynamics is everything it is the

1062
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,359
air it is the water it's the currents in

1063
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,280
the water

1064
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:39,520
is the weather it is this piece of wood

1065
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,200
maybe the wood is a solid but the heat

1066
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,839
flow through this wood

1067
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:49,200
is fluid and so this is a very

1068
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:52,720
hard problem to solve very compute

1069
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,560
intensive we used to build wind tunnels

1070
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,760
to test airplanes and to test

1071
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,160
cars for aerodynamics they were very

1072
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,200
expensive to build

1073
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,720
but you could simulate that if you had

1074
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,280
enough computing power

1075
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,319
and you wouldn't have to build this very

1076
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,520
expensive

1077
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:14,240
wind tunnel and so

1078
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,560
they said we can take this gigantic hard

1079
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,359
to solve problem and break it down into

1080
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,680
many many

1081
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,680
tiny little problems and instead of

1082
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,480
having a supercomputer do it

1083
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,800
we'll use these weak miserable crappy

1084
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,359
intel pcs

1085
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,520
to solve each tiny little problem and

1086
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,240
then bring the answers together

1087
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,880
and they called this the beowulf

1088
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,839
supercomputer

1089
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,359
now this was developed in 1994

1090
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,319
inadvertently

1091
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,599
i met a young man in 1995 who was going

1092
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,680
to university

1093
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,680
i said here's a copy of red hat linux

1094
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,359
all you read people out there i gave

1095
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,079
them red hat linux

1096
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,319
and overnight all the national

1097
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,200
laboratories in the united states used

1098
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,760
red hat linux to build their beowulf

1099
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,839
supercomputers

1100
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,359
that is actually a copy of the young man

1101
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,079
i gave that cd to

1102
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,400
his name is pakgoda and he's in front of

1103
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,599
a system called loki

1104
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,640
which pat was using to what to simulate

1105
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,560
what would happen

1106
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,440
if meteors crashed into the earth

1107
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,680
up until 2001 he was crashing them into

1108
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,839
new york city

1109
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,160
after september the 11th he chose los

1110
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,200
angeles

1111
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,040
but he still went on okay and today

1112
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,240
of the 5 000 fat or sorry the 500

1113
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,280
fastest computers in the world

1114
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,960
all of them run linux

1115
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
the same linux that you run on your

1116
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,680
laptop

1117
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,680
or your desktop

1118
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,560
two of them used to run micro used to

1119
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,960
run microsoft because microsoft paid

1120
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,240
them to run microsoft

1121
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,319
we can't have all 500 running linux

1122
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,720
you know pay them to run microsoft but

1123
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,960
it got too expensive

1124
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:13,359
they're still there but they're like 572

1125
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:16,160
of you know the 500 fastest computers

1126
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,880
you see they're a prize the gordon bell

1127
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,040
prize

1128
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,240
gordon bell works for the microsoft

1129
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,760
corporation

1130
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,000
in their supercomputer area they're

1131
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,040
named after him given to the best

1132
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,960
supercomputer

1133
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,960
it's never been won by microsoft

1134
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,800
i know gordon he's a great guy

1135
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,280
so the next thing that happened was the

1136
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,640
years of the unix desktop

1137
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,800
and actually let's just say linux

1138
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,359
desktop but

1139
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,520
you know unix we kept trying to get it

1140
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,680
onto the desktop

1141
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,280
and people would not use unix because

1142
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:56,000
they were too used to ms-dos and windows

1143
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,359
i don't know if you remember this but

1144
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,760
your parents

1145
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:02,079
when you said use the computer system

1146
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,960
they would write down in the notebook

1147
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,480
hit this button wait to the screen

1148
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,240
lights up

1149
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,920
type in this name type in this word

1150
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,520
that's your password

1151
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,599
and they would write this down in a

1152
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,160
notebook because that's the way they use

1153
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,160
computers

1154
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,079
and that's one reason why people did not

1155
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,160
switch over to using linux on the

1156
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,000
desktop because they were too used to

1157
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,480
using computers that way

1158
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,839
from this one standard interface or what

1159
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,400
they thought was standard

1160
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,559
microsoft another reason for

1161
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,720
not using the new linux was the lack of

1162
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:45,040
games

1163
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:48,640
now games is an interesting subject

1164
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:53,440
here in argentina you actually pirate

1165
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,440
about 84 percent of your desktop

1166
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,720
software

1167
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:10,240
yes you laugh and clap

1168
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:13,119
but what happens when it's your program

1169
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,800
that you have written and you are

1170
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,520
expecting to make money

1171
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,040
off of the software that you wrote

1172
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,160
you're expecting to feed

1173
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,480
your family you're expecting to be able

1174
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,760
to make your tuition to go to school

1175
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,760
is it so funny then

1176
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,160
this is one reason why i as a free

1177
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,559
software person

1178
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,640
are is adamant against software and

1179
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,200
privacy

1180
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,920
because it takes money out of the mouths

1181
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,960
of people

1182
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,960
who expected to make write that money

1183
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,319
write that software and make money from

1184
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,880
it

1185
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,640
instead you should be using truly free

1186
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,280
software software written with the

1187
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,559
intent

1188
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,200
of giving it away and the intent of

1189
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,920
having you

1190
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,559
help make it better a collaborative

1191
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,520
development model

1192
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:08,400
but with games it's even worse because

1193
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,400
the piracy rate of games is 99

1194
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,359
the game company makes the one cd and

1195
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,400
magically that cd is duplicated 50 000

1196
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,079
times yeah we

1197
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,160
we bought the one copy and this is why a

1198
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,880
lot of game companies are now

1199
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,160
giving away the game software and

1200
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,720
selling you plastic toys instead or

1201
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,520
making you attack attached to a server

1202
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,160
and pay

1203
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,920
a subscription fee because that's the

1204
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,920
only way that they can make money

1205
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,240
this is why when people say to me how do

1206
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,720
i make money with free software i say to

1207
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,440
them

1208
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:48,640
the very first thing you do is you write

1209
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,240
a business plan to make sure

1210
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,760
that after you've done the work of

1211
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,640
creating this free software that you

1212
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,319
have a way

1213
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,280
of making money to keep the free

1214
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,280
software going

1215
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,079
but the other reason why linux doesn't

1216
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,240
really make it on a desktop

1217
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,839
is the fact that most people need only

1218
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,480
five applications

1219
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,599
they really do they need a desktop

1220
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,079
application

1221
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,760
they need all this stuff and they never

1222
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,680
get to that

1223
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,240
i am told i'm out of time so i'm going

1224
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,680
to skip ahead a little bit

1225
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:23,680
another threat is apple where apple

1226
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,760
decided that computers weren't computers

1227
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,200
anymore they were actually consumer

1228
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,839
items

1229
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,240
they wanted you to buy an iphone because

1230
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,400
it was

1231
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,280
fancy and because you could brag to your

1232
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,680
friends

1233
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,400
not because it necessarily did anything

1234
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,520
you wanted

1235
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,880
it to do but android

1236
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,400
foiled apple's plan because remember

1237
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,640
there used to be ninety percent

1238
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,839
microsoft and seven percent

1239
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,400
apple microsoft took the philosophy if

1240
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,319
you could even say the word windows

1241
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,520
you could put your software on their

1242
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,079
hardware

1243
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,640
and apple said nobody will make money

1244
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,079
from us

1245
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,079
unless they're named apple

1246
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:09,200
android screwed up apple's plan

1247
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,359
because android is now the new microsoft

1248
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,200
if you could even say the word android

1249
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,680
you can have your application there

1250
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,280
you can put android on top of your

1251
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,440
hardware

1252
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,760
so all these hardware vendors are

1253
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,880
creating different platforms

1254
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,319
for people to use

1255
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,599
and now we have the cloud the cloud is

1256
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,920
another way

1257
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,880
that people can these companies can trap

1258
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,240
people

1259
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,040
into using their facility i come from

1260
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,960
this company

1261
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,680
in this country called the united states

1262
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,440
you may have heard of us

1263
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,880
and the united states has this law

1264
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:48,000
called the constitution

1265
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:52,160
which protects my privacy against

1266
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,440
these agencies which i've mentioned

1267
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:58,400
but you have no privacy in my country

1268
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,119
you have no rights under my law none

1269
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,880
zero

1270
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,359
zip and so if your data even creeps

1271
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,839
across

1272
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,839
our borders or goes through certain

1273
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,960
places that are controlled by us

1274
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:12,720
my country can look at your data with

1275
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,720
impunity

1276
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,920
if i entered into the conversation they

1277
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,720
have to stop

1278
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,400
because i'm a u.s citizen but as long as

1279
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,920
you're talking to yourselves you're

1280
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,280
talking to other people in other

1281
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,079
countries

1282
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,800
they can listen and they can change your

1283
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,599
data if they want to

1284
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,000
this is why it's important for you to

1285
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,200
make

1286
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,400
way to store your most important data

1287
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,559
inside of your country

1288
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,920
and you have to understand what happens

1289
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:47,359
when that data escapes

1290
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,599
your control you need

1291
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,400
we have to take back the cloud from the

1292
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,000
large cloud vendors

1293
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,960
i'm going to skip the summary of the

1294
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,200
history what i'd like to do

1295
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,599
is talk about the future for a bit

1296
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,359
we have users these days people that

1297
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,640
don't know about computers people have

1298
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,359
never written the program

1299
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,079
but they're using computers we have to

1300
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,200
make them

1301
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,280
understand about freedom

1302
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,040
we have to make them understand that the

1303
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,440
opposite of freedom is slavery

1304
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,119
companies tell you what to do when to go

1305
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,119
where to put the code

1306
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,640
what you can do with it when you have to

1307
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,800
retire it

1308
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,200
when you have to upgrade that is

1309
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,599
software slavery

1310
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,280
and when you're a slave you have no

1311
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,520
control

1312
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,359
you have no control over your life

1313
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,359
you're told when to marry when to have

1314
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,400
children when to die

1315
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:46,720
you are a slave

1316
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,599
and we don't want that because we are

1317
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,599
human beings

1318
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,000
some companies say they love open source

1319
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,720
in the ancient greek there were three

1320
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,200
words for love one was agape

1321
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,920
the love of god for man the love of

1322
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,680
mother for

1323
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,559
child but even a mother's child the

1324
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,760
mother's love

1325
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:12,720
is not without cost if you love me

1326
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,720
you'll take out the garbage

1327
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:20,079
if you love me you'll feed the dog

1328
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:23,839
but it is the greatest of love

1329
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:26,319
the second love is filos brotherly love

1330
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:29,200
from that we give philanthropy in

1331
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:32,400
philadelphia and psychology

1332
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,839
philadelphia the city of brotherly love

1333
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,960
the love of you for your friends

1334
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,720
not quite agape but then there's the

1335
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,920
third love

1336
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:49,760
errors the deepest

1337
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:53,440
dirtiest love sexual love

1338
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:57,359
we get erotic from that erotica

1339
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:59,359
sex that is the love

1340
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,480
that some companies have for free

1341
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,000
software

1342
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,400
and open source do not bend over in the

1343
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,400
shower

1344
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,480
we are very close to world domination 60

1345
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,599
of all the servers in the world run

1346
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,280
linux the 500 fastest computers in the

1347
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,359
world run linux

1348
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,480
most embedded systems your d-link

1349
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,200
routers your elderly

1350
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,240
elsa's routers either run linux or bsd

1351
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,319
we are very

1352
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,000
all of the major companies in the world

1353
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:31,760
run free software in some way

1354
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,280
shape or form you just have to go

1355
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,960
a little bit further and that's your job

1356
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:41,920
your job is to publicize free software

1357
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,760
is to publicize why it's good is to make

1358
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,799
people understand that with free

1359
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,680
software they

1360
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,680
have control

1361
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,079
i'm still working on a series of

1362
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:56,079
projects but quite frankly

1363
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:59,119
i'm 69. my brother retired at 55

1364
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,359
most people i know retired is 65 i've

1365
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,559
had three heart attacks

1366
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,720
but i am working on a few projects like

1367
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,839
caninus lucas which was shown down in

1368
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,200
the stand for these last three days

1369
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,160
these are computers that we are

1370
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:18,000
designing and building in brazil

1371
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,000
and i'm here in argentina to help you

1372
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,839
start designing the same type of

1373
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
computers here

1374
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,520
i've made some good contacts we're going

1375
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,040
to share ideas

1376
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,040
and we're gonna start building these

1377
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,839
computers in latin america instead of

1378
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,240
sending

1379
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:36,319
billions and trillions of pesos to china

1380
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,079
i have nothing against china i have a

1381
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:42,720
lot of chinese friends

1382
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,640
but they make enough money and i want to

1383
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,319
create jobs in argentina

1384
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,640
and i want to create jobs in latin

1385
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,319
america

1386
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,559
and there's things like internet of

1387
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,960
things which are too dangerous

1388
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:58,079
to allow this to be done by people

1389
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,920
outside of your country

1390
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:05,760
we need to have software freedom

1391
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:09,839
for them finally

1392
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,839
thank you

1393
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:22,000

micro distillery and bait shop

1398
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,119

1399
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:40,480
bait shop
